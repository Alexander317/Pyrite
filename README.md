## About
Pyrite aims to expand on Vanilla's block palette with new wood types, bricks, and more.

It's inspired by mods like [Quark](https://quarkmod.net), [Stoneworks](https://modrinth.com/mod/stoneworks), and [Charm](https://modrinth.com/mod/charm) that expand on Minecraft without feeling too unfamiliar.

Pyrite is available for Minecraft Fabric 1.20.1. Legacy versions are available on GitHub and Modrinth, but are not as actively updated as the 1.20.1 version and may be missing features. No Forge port is planned.

## Features
