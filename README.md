## About
Pyrite aims to expand on Vanilla's block palette with new wood types, bricks, and more.

It's inspired by mods like Quark and Charm that expand on Minecraft without feeling too unfamiliar.

Pyrite is available for Minecraft Fabric 1.20.1. While legacy versions are on GitHub, they are not recommended for use at this time as they are missing core features and reflect an older idea for the mod.

## Features
- Stained Planks, in every colour of dye (and more!)
- Cobblestone Bricks
