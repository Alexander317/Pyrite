For consistency and to include additional features, Pyrite makes small changes to vanilla recipes and world generation.

## Variant Crafting Tables

Added in Pyrite 0.12, Crafting Tables are available in all Vanilla wood types. Default crafting tables have been renamed to Oak Crafting Tables. If you need a Vanilla crafting table for any reason, you can craft variant crafting tables back into vanilla ones.

## Iron Crafting Changes

Iron Bars and Iron Trapdoors have had their crafting recipes changed to be more consistent with Pyrite's blocks. Bars can be made with Cut Iron, and Trapdoors with Iron Ingots.

## Mushroom Stems
